This job search gui application allows the user to do several tasks: 

1. Enter a job number and search for job project folder 
3. Open job folder after searching. (toggle open on search in preference panel)
4. Displays current job number and current directory 


In the background, a job search index program will run every few hours and index the 
entire company job folders and general data. This will be run on a server that Admin can setup.
